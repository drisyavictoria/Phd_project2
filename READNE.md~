Some of the programms developed for my Phd_work2 are included in this repository. Detailed frequency level analysis of wind speed data is done for a better understanding of the system dynamics. For analysis, we used 10 min resolution wind speed data measured at 234 different locations of the period from January 2004 to January 2007. The data can be downloaded from National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA website, http://www.nrel.gov.

The results of this work have been published in Renewable energy Journal, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148117312193 .
