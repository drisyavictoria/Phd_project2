Part of the codes developed for my Phd_work2 are included in this repository. Detailed frequency level analysis is done for understaing the wind speed dynamics. Most of the programs were written in shell script along with R and C programs. For analysis, we used 10 min resolution wind speed data measured at 212 different locations of the period from January 2004 to January 2007. The data can be downloaded from National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA website, http://www.nrel.gov.
